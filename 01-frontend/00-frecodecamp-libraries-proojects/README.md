# Freecodecamp libraries projects!
Hi there! It's me again!! ðŸ™Œ

This repository will contain a few projects for a **Freecodecamp** certification based on _Frontend libraries and Interfaces_. Hope you take a look and be free to tell me if there's any issue! 

## About 
Most projects (all if I'm not wrong) are developed with React.js. I used frameworks like Next.js but that doesn't really matter. The fact was to use React, so you can clone the repositories and take a look in a development workspace! Typically, each project has its own README with specific instructions to get started, so see you then!

## Projects Overview
For Frontend section I can deploy these projects for free but I didn't. I prefered to "deploy" them in _codepen.io_

Here's a brief overview of the projects you'll find in this repository:

- [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/taidmc/details/QWYBmQw): A Pomodoro clock to focus on your work!
- [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/taidmc/pen/BaPNEEr): A Random Quote Machine with quotes to think for a while
- [Calculator](https://codepen.io/taidmc/details/KKGmapP): A very cool calculator!
