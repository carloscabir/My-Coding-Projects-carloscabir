# Welcome to my Code Projects Repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a collection of various coding projects and experiments I've worked on. Feel free to explore the different projects and find something that interests you.

## About

This repository serves as a showcase of my coding journey, where I've experimented with different technologies, languages, frameworks, and concepts. You'll find a mix of personal projects, tutorials, and experiments that I've undertaken to learn and grow as a developer. 

Also I want to say that there are not a lot of projects, this because of I want to upload in this repository the projects with a possible future and a possible selection for my future portfolio. I mean that these projects are a little bit more serious and I work more on them than I usually do with any other one exersise or project. Though, lots of projects are in my repositories where I was learning I was building little projects, such as: [My Code Odyssey](https://github.com/carloscabir/My-Code-Odyssey-carloscabir) or [Little Projects](https://github.com/carloscabir/my-little-projects)
