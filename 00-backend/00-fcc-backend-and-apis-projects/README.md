# Freecodecamp Backend Development Projects!
Hi there! Hope you're doing well! ðŸ‘‹

The purpose of this repository is that will contain all the repositories of the _projects_ of my **Freecodecamp Backend Development** _course_.

## About 
I want to say that all the projects are in this repository might not be in production due to I cannot afford a server deployment that can work all the time. I just deploy each project to a free deployment service but the service is limited, so your probably won't see the app in production!
So, Let's take a look and see some of my work!

## Feedback
You are welcome to feel free to take a look and if there's an issue with something just let me know, I'll be very thankfully!

See you!!!
